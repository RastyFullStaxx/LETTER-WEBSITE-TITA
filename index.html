              My Dearest Love,
            </h1>

            <p class="text-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
              Happy, happy birthday to the man who has captured my whole heart.
              On this special day, I just want to pour out everything I feel for
              you, because you deserve to know the depth of my love and
              gratitude.
              <br /><br />
              Thank you — for loving me in ways I never imagined possible, for
              supporting me even when times get hard, for making me feel safe
              even from miles away. I am so blessed, so incredibly lucky, that
              God brought you into my life. You are not just a chapter in my
              story — you are the most beautiful part of it, the one I never
              want to end.
              <br /><br />
              Even though distance stands between us right now, my heart has
              never felt closer to anyone than it does to you. I believe with
              every beat of my heart that we can overcome this. One day, all
              these lonely nights and longing days will be worth it, because
              they will lead us to the moment when I can finally hold you again.
              That day will come, and when it does, I will never want to let go.
              <br /><br />
              Let us keep holding on to our trust, our faith, and our love.
              Always remember — God is here, watching over us, guiding our steps
              until we meet again. He has written our love story, and no
              distance, no obstacle, can change that. You are the first and only
              man I have ever truly loved, and I promise you will be the last.
              My love for you is forever, unchanging, and growing stronger each
              day.
              <br /><br />
              On your birthday, my biggest wish is for you to succeed in all the
              dreams you carry in your heart. I pray you find happiness, peace,
              and fulfillment in everything you do. I will always be here,
              standing beside you in spirit, cheering for you from afar. I am
              proud of you in every way, and I believe in you more than you will
              ever know.
              <br /><br />
              I love you so deeply that even the longest words in the dictionary
              feel too small to hold my feelings. I miss you with every breath,
              every sunrise, and every star-filled night. I long for the day I
              can finally welcome you here in the Philippines — to see you walk
              towards me, to feel your arms wrap around me, to hear your voice
              not through a phone, but right beside my ear. I imagine it over
              and over, and that hope keeps me going.
              <br /><br />
              Until that moment, please carry my love with you wherever you go.
              You are my heart, my joy, my safe place, my forever. I will wait
              for you — with love that never fades, with faith that never
              breaks, and with the unshakable hope that soon, our "goodbyes"
              will turn into "welcome home."
              <br /><br />
              Happy birthday, my love. You are my always and my forever.
            </p>
